# odin-recipes

write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.

This project is to create a recipe website. I have learnt the basics of HTML tags, ordered and unordered lists, images etc. And the importance of commit messages and the very basics of using git. 

I also created the folders using the terminal and have some familiarity with moving through the folders, mkdir, touch etc. I need to improve on opening the files and doing things with them though.
